# Problem Solving Repository

Welcome to my Problem Solving Repository! 🚀  
This repository contains coding problems solved using **complex data structures and algorithms** from various competitive programming contests and independent practice. It serves as a record of my journey, tracking progress, and showcasing solutions to challenging problems.

## Topics Covered

The problems here involve advanced concepts such as:

- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Heaps, Priority Queues
- Hashing Techniques
- Advanced Sorting and Searching
- Mathematical & Number Theory Problems

**Platforms Practiced On:** [CSES, LeetCode, Phitron Contest, AtCoder, Code Ninja 360, CodeChef, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, Online Judge]

## Languages Used

Most problems are solved in **C++**, which is my primary language, with occasional use of other languages:

```text
  C
  C++ (Primary – Major Problem Solving)
  Python
  Go
  JavaScript
```
